# Welcome to the HeavyEyelid Project wiki!

This project's goal is to provide an HTTP API to control the libvirt daemon, a virtual machine API written in C.
For this purpose, we are using the Boost.Beast library to build an asynchronous Web server that transcodes JSON queries to the libvirt daemon.

In this wiki, you will find all the functions that we would like to implement, alongside the complete documentation of our current API.

This project is at its initial state, and we will update this wiki gradually during the progression of the project.
